Quadrado Asset Builder

Font     :: n..1 with simple config
BoxStyle :: 1..1 with complex config
MapRoom  :: 1..1 with complex config
Sprite   :: 1..n with complex config
TileSet  :: 1..n with complex config

=====================
each asset type has a baseline required for new, 
then an editor/viewer,
and the ability to delete (with cascade where sensible)
